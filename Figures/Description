These are some of the Eigenvalue Deviation (or Mean) vs Lattice plots that I got. 

I haven't uploaded the histograms of eigenvalues or any other value because these plots are more interesting to me as the histograms just confirm the sandpile 
and chaotic behavior. But these (I am not sure at all) might give us insight into the statistical evolution.
